*                           THEORY OF OPERATION
*******************************************************************************
* This project will showcase the capability of PSoC 4 BLE to communicate 
* bi-directionally with a BLE Central device over custom services. 
* The LPM SEL custom service allows 
* read and write of attributes under the LPM characteristics.
* This allows the selection of the low power mode operation, ideal for battery operated 
* devices. The project utlizes Deep Sleep feature of both BLESS and CPU to remain 
* in low power mode as much as possible, while maintaining the BLE connection and  
* data transfer. This allows the device to run on coin cell battery for long time.
*
* Note:
* The programming pins have been configured as GPIO, and not SWD. This is because 
* when programming pins are configured for SWD, then the silicon consumes extra
* power through the pins. To prevent the leakage of power, the pins have been set 
* to GPIO. With this setting, the kit can still be acquired by PSoC Creator or
* PSoC Programmer software tools for programming, but the project cannot be 
* externally debugged. To re-enable debugging, go to PSoC_4_BLE_CapSense_Slider_LED.cydwr 
* from Workspace Explorer, go to Systems tab, and set the Debug Select option to 'SWD'.
* Build and program this project to enable external Debugging.
*
* Refer to BLE Pioneer Kit user guide for details.
